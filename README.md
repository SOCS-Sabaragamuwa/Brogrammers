## Garbage Management API

Welcome to the Garbage Management System designed by SOCSSabaragamuwa. We are delighted to accompany you throughout this journey to go green.

The communication culture, communication channels and the contributing policies as well as the documentation best practices are given below.

## DevOps Stages
•	Version Control- Source code management is done with git and who does the change is also recorded with git. With proper documentation policies and pull request templates the version control is addressed in our project.
•	Continuous integration -jenkins 
•	Continuous delivery -jenkins
•	Continuous deployment -not done in our project as we will validate every pull request

## Communication Channels

## Communication culture

Please treat each other, as well as the public, in an excellent way. What it means to “be excellent” is the following:

Be radically inclusive to existing members and newcomers looking to learn or participate
Be totally respectful of each others abilities, interests, and personal differences
Be exceedingly kind even in moments of disagreement while working towards consensus
Educate and illuminate others with something you know more about
Be open to feedback from others in the community, be it technical skill or interpersonally
These traits exemplify the type of community we strive for with Open Source Design. We want a diverse community where members treat each other excellently, at all times.

We want Open Source Design to be diverse because we A) believe in equality and B) know that diversity leads to healthier culture, which outputs better creativity.


## Contributing guidelines
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

When making a pull request fill the pull request template generated, in clear and simple terminologies highlighting what was changed.

If you need help, you can ask questions on our mailing list and the slack channel.
